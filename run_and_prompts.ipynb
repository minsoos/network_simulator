She added that \"he hit a taxi driver, that the vehicle is his source of work, therefore, he will be unable to work, in addition to the license he has... he also injured another person.\" . Likewise, she emphasized that Mackenna crossed the red light, which is why she \"committed a traffic violation, in addition to driving while intoxicated.\" \"He will agree to the request of the Prosecutor's Office, and preventive detention will be ordered,\" said the judge, specifying that an investigation period of 90 days was determined.\n",
