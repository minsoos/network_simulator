Agregó que \"él chocó a un taxista, que el vehículo es su fuente de trabajo, por lo tanto, va a quedar sin poder trabajar, además de la licencia que tiene... También lesionó a otra persona\". Asimismo, enfatizó que Mackenna cruzó en luz roja, por lo que \"comete una infracción de tránsito, además del manejo en estado de ebriedad\". \"Se va a acceder a la solicitud de la Fiscalía, y se va a decretar la prisión preventiva\", señaló la jueza, precisando que se determinó un plazo de investigación de 90 días.\n",
