Al practicarle la alcoholemia, arrojó 1,27 gramos de alcohol por litro de sangre. \"Nos tenemos que fijar en la conducta del imputado y en la forma en que pone en riesgo la vida de tercera personas, lo cual efectivamente pasó el día de hoy\", aseguró jueza Acevedo. Agregó que \"él chocó a un taxista, que el vehículo es su fuente de trabajo, por lo tanto, va a quedar sin poder trabajar, además de la licencia que tiene... También lesionó a otra persona\". Asimismo, enfatizó que Mackenna cruzó en luz roja, por lo que \"comete una infracción de tránsito, además del manejo en estado de ebriedad\". \"Se va a acceder a la solicitud de la Fiscalía, y se va a decretar la prisión preventiva\", señaló la jueza, precisando que se determinó un plazo de investigación de 90 días.\n",

Al practicarle la alcoholemia, arrojó 1,27 gramos de alcohol por litro de sangre. \"Nos tenemos que fijar en la conducta del imputado y en la forma en que pone en riesgo la vida de tercera personas, lo cual efectivamente pasó el día de hoy\", aseguró jueza Acevedo. Agregó que \"él chocó a un taxista, que el vehículo es su fuente de trabajo, por lo tanto, va a quedar sin poder trabajar, además de la licencia que tiene... También lesionó a otra persona\". Asimismo, enfatizó que Mackenna cruzó en luz roja, por lo que \"comete una infracción de tránsito, además del manejo en estado de ebriedad\". \"Se va a acceder a la solicitud de la Fiscalía, y se va a decretar la prisión preventiva\", señaló la jueza, precisando que se determinó un plazo de investigación de 90 días.\n",
